# Repository Description: Simple Store Project

This Git repository hosts the source code for the "Simple Store" project. A web application developed in Visual Studio using the C# programming language, built on the .NET Framework Core and ASP.NET Core technologies. 
The project leverages the Entity Framework for data access, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, and adhering to a three-tier architecture.

Key Technologies:

Programming Language: C#
Frameworks:
1. .NET Framework Core: 
The project is built on the .NET Framework Core, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and efficient resource utilization.
2. ASP.NET Core: 
The web application utilizes ASP.NET Core for building robust and scalable web services and interfaces.
3. Entity Framework: 
The Entity Framework is employed for data access, providing a powerful object-relational mapping (ORM) capability to interact with the underlying database. 

Design Patterns and Architecture:
1. MVC Design Pattern: 
The project follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern, promoting a modular and maintainable code structure. 
The separation of concerns enables efficient development, testing, and future enhancements.
2. Three-Tier Architecture: 
The application architecture is organized into three distinct layers:
- Presentation Layer (View): Responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
- Business Logic Layer (Controller): Contains the application's business logic, orchestrating the flow of data between the model and the view.
- Data Access Layer (Model): Manages interactions with the database through the Entity Framework, encapsulating data-related operations.

Version Control and Collaboration:
Git: The repository uses Git for version control, allowing for collaborative development, code tracking, and easy integration of new features or bug fixes.
Branching Strategy: The project employs a branching strategy to organize and manage different aspects of development, such as feature development, bug fixes, and releases.
